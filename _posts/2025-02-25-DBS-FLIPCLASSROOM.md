## Database Users and Database Administrators

### What i learn during Flip Classroom 
- Database User:
Interacts with the database to view, update, or delete data using applications.
Example: Employees querying data or updating records.

- Database Administrator (DBA):
Manages, maintains, and secures the database, ensuring it runs smoothly and efficiently.
Example: DBAs handle backups, performance tuning, and user access.

Key Difference:
Users work with data for tasks, while DBAs manage and secure the database system.

### What I Did During the Flipped Class:
- During the flipped classroom session, we:

  - Formed Groups: Divided into 4 groups (G1 to G4) of 6-7 students.
  - Expert Groups: 
    - G1 & G2 discussed types of database users.
    - G3 & G4 discussed the role of database administrators (DBAs).
  - Expert Group Discussions: Shared ideas and our understanding of the topics.
  - Master Groups: we changed our member to share and discuss what we learned from Expert Group.
  - Quiz: Reinforced the concepts with a quiz.
The session involved collaboration and knowledge sharing on database users and DBAs
